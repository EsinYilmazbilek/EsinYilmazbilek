- 👋 Hi, I’m @EsinYilmazbilek
- A Junior Full Stack Developer with project management skills. After 8+ years managing projects and teams, I added programming to my skillset by completing an immersive 12-week Software Engineering bootcamp at General Assembly in London. Following the bootcamp, I joined the tech industry, offering programming and project management skills to achieve sustainable outcomes.

After working as a Junior Frontend Engineer at a London based consultancy, I have recently relocated to Adelaide with a Partner Visa and I am now searching for my next role. I am keen to build upon my knowledge and continue to learn in an engaging and collaborative environment as I grow as a software engineer.

- 🌱 I’m graduate of the immersive 3-month Software Engineering bootcamp at General Assembly, London.
- 🤝🏿 Over the course of 3 months I delivered 4 projects:
1. Bord Space Invaders: A Vanilla JavaScript creation of Space Invaders (Solo)
2. Clever Nightingale: An English Dictionary using React with integrated 3rd part API (Pair)
3. Sniff: A matchmaking website (for our furry friends - because why not?) using MERN (Group)
4. Honey & Thyme: A Pinterest clone using React, Django, PostgreSQL (Pair)
